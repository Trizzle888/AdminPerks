# AdminPerks
A Minecraft plugin that allows admins to have abilities.

There are currently three enable commands and three disable commands. /adminfly, /adminflydisable, /adminimmortal, /adminimmortaldisable, /admininvincible and /admininvincibledisable
Im sure this is pretty straightforward. Running the command if you have perms gives you the ability.
